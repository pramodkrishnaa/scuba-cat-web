> **Note:** this is the original Python/OpenCV desktop prototype, superseded by the browser web app in the repo root. Kept here for history. Its gesture detector never actually used MediaPipe despite this doc's claims below (it's plain motion-diffing), and some numbers here have drifted from the code — known issues, not fixed up, since this folder is a historical snapshot.

# Scuba Cat Gesture Detector 🐱

A real-time gesture detection application that captures camera feed and plays the scuba cat meme when you perform the scuba cat gesture!

## Features

- **Real-time gesture detection** using MediaPipe hand tracking
- **Automatic video playback** when gesture is detected
- **Gesture recognition** for scuba cat movement (left hand on face + right hand scooping motion)
- **Webcam integration** with live feedback
- **Cooldown system** to prevent multiple rapid triggers

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam/Camera
- Scuba cat meme video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, or MKV)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add your scuba cat meme video:
   - Place your video file in the `assets/` folder
   - Name it `scuba_cat.mp4` (or edit `main.py` line 13 with your filename)

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Perform the scuba cat gesture:**
   - Put your LEFT hand near your mouth/face area
   - Move your RIGHT hand in a scooping motion
   - Hold the gesture for about 0.3 seconds
   - The scuba cat meme will play!

3. **Controls:**
   - Press `q` to quit the application
   - Press `p` to manually play the video (for testing)

## How It Works

### Gesture Detection Algorithm

The gesture detector uses Google's MediaPipe library to track hand positions in real-time:

1. **Left Hand Detection**: Checks if left hand is in the face/mouth region
2. **Right Hand Movement**: Detects motion in the right hand (scooping gesture)
3. **Confirmation**: Requires the gesture to be held for ~10 frames (~0.3 seconds) before triggering
4. **Cooldown**: Prevents multiple rapid triggers (2-second cooldown)

### System Components

- **GestureDetector**: Analyzes hand landmarks to identify the scuba cat gesture
- **VideoPlayer**: Handles video playback in a separate thread for smooth operation
- **Main Loop**: Captures camera frames, detects gestures, and manages UI

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected
- Check that your webcam is connected and working
- Try changing `CAMERA_INDEX` in `main.py` (0 for default, 1, 2, etc. for other cameras)

### Gesture not detected
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- The detector works best with clear hand visibility
- Try adjusting the `min_detection_confidence` in `gesture_detector.py` (line 14)
- Lower values = more sensitive but less accurate

### Video not playing
- Verify the video file exists in `assets/` folder
- Check the file format (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV supported)
- Try using a different video format or converting it

### Performance issues
- Reduce camera resolution in `main.py`
- Comment out the landmark drawing line for better performance
- Close other applications consuming CPU/GPU

## Customization

### Change the gesture
Edit the `detect_scuba_cat_gesture()` method in `gesture_detector.py` to detect different hand movements

### Adjust sensitivity
- `required_frames` in `GestureDetector.__init__()`: How long gesture must be held (default: 10 frames)
- `cooldown_frames` in `main.py`: Delay between consecutive triggers (default: 60 frames)
- `min_detection_confidence` in `gesture_detector.py`: Hand detection confidence threshold (0-1)

### Use different video
Update `VIDEO_PATH` in `main.py` to point to your custom video file

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Lighting**: Good lighting helps hand detection
2. **Distance**: Keep hands 1-2 feet from camera
3. **Movement**: Make smooth, deliberate gestures
4. **Patience**: The gesture needs to be held for a moment (~0.3 seconds)
